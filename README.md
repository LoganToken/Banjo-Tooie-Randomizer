# Banjo-Tooie-Randomizer

## How to Play

1. add Bizhawk_Randomizer.lua and a seed (such as Randomizer_Seed_######.lua) to the same directory
2. edit line 3 in Bizhawk_Randomizer.lua to include the filename of your seed e.g. local rewards_table = require("Randomizer_Seed_######"); where ###### is the seed number you want to play
3. open Bizhawk_Randomizer.lua and a Tooie rom in bizhawk
4. Currently the Logic only works with pattern 1 (pattern 17 in ScriptHawk)
